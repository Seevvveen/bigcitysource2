# This is a proper port of gm_bigcity from garrysmod

## Things to note
- ITS ALL DEV MATERIALS
- Most if not all triggers have been removed (including door teleports)
- The orginal source 1 skybox is left intact but is hidden using a selection set
- All geomtry should be 1:1
- Used instancing for many of the repeated componets
- the bridge at the sewer plant is missing its supports since it was a prop
- All geometry is aligned to grid, however i have no idea where the grid visably appears so... goodluck

# This is not a final map, this is just a foundation for those intrested in creating their own versions of bigcity
